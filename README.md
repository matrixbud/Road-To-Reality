# Road-To-Reality
1. My notes. I filled in MANY details and added lots of stuff I needed to know in order to help me understand the book

2. Solutions to problems in Roger Penrose's Book "Road To Reality". 
   I mostly only include problems that (1) were not posted by others, or (2) that I felt were simpler or very different
   than those already posted, or (3) correct errors that I found in posted solutions

3. For Problem 13.7 I developed a Mathematica application that performs geometric algebra calculations. It is available
   for free here on my github site. This problem was massively difficult and so I developed a shorter (13 pages long) less 
   rigorous version in addition to the rigorous version (29 pages)

Note: This repository sorts file names alphabetically, not numerically.
   For example, [13.7] is sorted AFTER [13.18] because 18 precedes 7 alphabetically.

Note: Files are in both pdf and docx formats. The latter was generated in Word 2011 (Mac) using MathType for equations
